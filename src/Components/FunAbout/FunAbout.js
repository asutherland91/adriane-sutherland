          Outside of coding, I enjoy filling my free time with fun hobbies and activities. 
          You can often find me curled up with a good book,
          taking leisurely walks around my city, playing board games with friends,
          or baking up a storm in the kitchen. My baked goods are pretty
          legendary - I'd be happy to trade cookie recipes anytime! I am a huge animal person,
          I have cats myself, but love pretty much any kind of pet you could imagine!
